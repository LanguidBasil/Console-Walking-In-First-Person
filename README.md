# I-Used-To-Love-Mazes
Oldschooly game about mazes, walking, and nothing else :) 

Simple 3D game in console. Very simple algorithms, no dependencies and cute ASCII graphics! I was looking for a refresher and stumbled upon [this amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw) on 3D graphics and decided to give it a try. First build was done in two days and it was so exciting I made it into a game (a simple one but still).

Window setup: <br/>
'Windows.h's API is a nightmare, I couldn't set window size automatically so you need to do it yourself ;(
Right click on game window, choose 'Properties' and on tab 'Layout' set screen buffer size to 120 width, 40 height and enable text wrapping.

Controlls: <br/>
'W' - go forwards <br/>
'S' - go baskwards <br/>
'A' - go right <br/>
'D' - go left <br/>
'→' - rotate right <br/>
'←' - rotate left <br/>

  'Delete' - debug message <br/>
  'M' - show map <br/>
